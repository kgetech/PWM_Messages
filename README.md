Description: Implementation of scanning 
8-digit 7-segment display with PWM 
dimming in Verilog for the Nexys A7-50T 
development board by Digilent

ToDo / Changes:

12.23.2020
This is my second working FPGA project in 
Verilog, no synchronization methods have 
been implemented yet, and naming 
conventions are all amuck. In addition, 
there's some code that is likely to 
synthesize strangely. This code is
pending some major refactoring.
